---

# Input
- Refined feature_slug with pre-approved tasks from refinement phase stored in MCP database

# Output
No file must be created for this workflow. All outputs should be returned in the response and any code changes should be committed to the appropriate feature branch in the repository.

# Step 1 - Prerequisites and Validation
- **[UPDATED - Rec 1]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_snapshot` for context-efficient feature overview (instead of `get_feature`)
- Confirm all tasks have status "ReadyForDevelopment"
- Review the summary:
  - Feature objective and acceptance criteria (pre-approved)
  - Dependencies identified in refinement
  - Stakeholder feedback summary from all 4 reviewers
  - Priority and scope
- **[NEW - Rec 5]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_metrics` to check health score and identify any concerns before starting
- Confirm this is ready for development

# Step 2 - Stakeholder Decisions Review
- Review stakeholder analysis from task transitions (already validated)
- Confirm architecture decisions from Architect review
- Verify technical specifications and design patterns
- Review security requirements from Security Officer approval
- Review UX requirements from UI/UX Expert approval

# Step 3 - Codebase Investigation
- Search codebase for related services, components, and existing patterns
- Identify relevant repositories, services, controllers, and middleware
- Query DB schemas if applicable: tables, foreign keys, constraints
- Validate that recommended architecture is compatible with existing codebase

# Step 4 - Task Verification & Execution Planning
- **[UPDATED - Rec 1]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_snapshot` to verify all required tasks exist
- Confirm all tasks have status "ReadyForDevelopment"
- **[NEW - Rec 4]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_task_execution_plan` to:
  - Determine optimal execution order
  - Identify parallelizable tasks
  - Review critical path and any warnings
- Use the optimal order from execution plan instead of just orderOfExecution

# Step 5 - Feature Branch Creation
- Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<feature_slug>/description`
- Initial commit to establish branch

# Step 6 - Development Cycle (BATCHED BY ROLE)
**CRITICAL: Process ALL tasks through each role in a single batch before moving to next role. Adopt each role ONCE per batch to minimize context switching.**

## 6.0 - Initialize Task List
- Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_tasks_by_status` with status "ReadyForDevelopment"
- Store all task IDs for processing

## 6.1 - DEVELOPER BATCH (IMPLEMENT ALL TASKS)
**Single developer identity for entire batch:**
- Adopt Developer role ONCE for entire batch
- Sort tasks by orderOfExecution
- For each task (implement ALL in sequence):
  - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_next_step` to get systemPrompt and previousRoleNotes
  - Review ALL stakeholder feedback:
    - Product Director notes (UX/feature requirements)
    - Architect notes (technical approach, design patterns)
    - UI/UX Expert notes (usability, accessibility)
    - Security Officer notes (security requirements, compliance)
  - Implement the feature following stakeholder guidance
  - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
  - Document implementation approach
- Once ALL tasks implemented:
  - **[BUILD VERIFICATION]** Run the appropriate build command for the project's language and toolchain (e.g., `npm run build`, `mvn package`, `cargo build`, `go build`, `python -m py_compile`, etc.) — confirm it succeeds with zero errors before proceeding
  - **[APP VERIFICATION]** Start the application using the appropriate run command for the project (e.g., `npm start`, `java -jar app.jar`, `./target/app`, `go run main.go`, `python app.py`, etc.) and confirm it starts and runs correctly without runtime errors; stop the process after confirming it is healthy
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_transition_tasks` to move ALL from InProgress → InReview in one call:
    - `taskIds`: All implemented task IDs
    - `fromStatus`: "InProgress"
    - `toStatus`: "InReview"
    - `metadata`: Shared developer notes (or leave per-task for detail)
  - **[NEW - Rec 3]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__save_workflow_checkpoint` with description "After developer batch - all tasks in InReview"
- **Progress output**: "Developer batch complete: [N] tasks implemented and moved to InReview"
- Commit all changes with message: `feature/<feature_slug>: implement all tasks`

## 6.2 - CODE REVIEWER BATCH (REVIEW ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS)
**Single code reviewer identity for entire batch:**
- Adopt Code Reviewer role ONCE for entire batch
- Get all tasks with status "InReview"
- For each task (review ALL):
  - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_next_step` to get systemPrompt and previousRoleNotes
  - Review all code changes listed in filesChanged
  - Review test files and coverage
  - Verify adherence to:
    - Architect recommendations (design patterns, technology choices)
    - Security requirements (Security Officer notes)
    - Code quality standards (clean code, documentation)
  - Prepare review notes
- Once ALL reviews completed:
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_transition_tasks` for APPROVED tasks from InReview → InQA:
    - `taskIds`: All approved task IDs
    - `fromStatus`: "InReview"
    - `toStatus`: "InQA"
    - `metadata`: Code reviewer notes
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_transition_tasks` for REJECTED tasks from InReview → NeedsChanges:
    - `taskIds`: All rejected task IDs
    - `fromStatus`: "InReview"
    - `toStatus`: "NeedsChanges"
    - `metadata`: Issues found and required changes
- **Progress output**: "Code Reviewer batch complete: [N] approved → InQA, [M] rejected → NeedsChanges"

## 6.3 - QA BATCH (TEST ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS)
**Single QA identity for entire batch:**
- Adopt QA role ONCE for entire batch
- Get all tasks with status "InQA"
- For each task (test ALL):
  - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_next_step` to get systemPrompt, previousRoleNotes, and test scenarios
  - Execute all test scenarios from task definition
  - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
  - Test against stakeholder requirements:
    - Product Director requirements (feature behavior)
    - UI/UX Expert requirements (usability, accessibility)
    - Security Officer requirements (security controls)
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Collect all AC updates and use `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_update_acceptance_criteria` to mark ALL verified criteria at once:
    - Pass array of `{ taskId, criterionId, verified }` for each AC being marked
  - Prepare testing notes
- Once ALL tests completed:
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_transition_tasks` for PASSED tasks from InQA → Done:
    - `taskIds`: All passing task IDs
    - `fromStatus`: "InQA"
    - `toStatus`: "Done"
    - `metadata`: QA notes and test execution summary
  - **[NEW - Rec 2]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__batch_transition_tasks` for FAILED tasks from InQA → NeedsChanges:
    - `taskIds`: All failing task IDs
    - `fromStatus`: "InQA"
    - `toStatus`: "NeedsChanges"
    - `metadata`: Failed tests and bugs found
- **Progress output**: "QA batch complete: [N] passed → Done, [M] failed → NeedsChanges"

## 6.4 - Handle Tasks Needing Changes (If Any)
- Get all tasks with status "NeedsChanges"
- If any tasks need changes:
  - **[NEW - Rec 5]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_metrics` to see if rework cycles are high (warning pattern)
  - Review feedback from code reviewer or QA
  - Address all identified issues
  - Re-enter developer phase for fixes:
    - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__transition_task_status` from NeedsChanges → InProgress
    - Make required fixes
    - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__transition_task_status` from InProgress → InReview
  - Tasks re-enter code review queue (Step 6.2)
  - Repeat cycles until all tasks reach "Done"
- Commit fixes with message: `feature/<feature_slug>: address review feedback`

## 6.5 - Iteration Management & Checkpoint Intervals
- After each batch completes:
  - Check for any tasks in "NeedsChanges" status
  - If found, process developer fixes in batch
  - **[NEW - Rec 5]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_metrics` to check health score after each batch
  - **[NEW - Rec 3]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__save_workflow_checkpoint` periodically:
    - After code review batch completes: "After code review batch - ready for QA"
    - After QA batch completes: "After QA batch - [N] done, [M] need fixes"
  - Continue batched review/QA until all tasks reach "Done"
  - This batched approach minimizes context switching and improves efficiency

## 6.6 - Workflow Interruption & Resume
- **[NEW - Rec 3]** If workflow is interrupted (token limit, connection loss):
  - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__list_workflow_checkpoints` to see all saved checkpoints
  - Call `mcp__task-review-manager__restore_workflow_checkpoint` with the most recent checkpoint ID
  - Resume from the next logical phase (e.g., if last checkpoint was "After developer batch", resume with code review)
- This enables long-running workflows to survive interruptions

## 6.7 - Final Task Verification & PR Prep
- Call `mcp__task-review-manager__verify_all_tasks_complete` to confirm ALL tasks have status "Done"
- Review task completion: confirm all tasks show proper transition history
- Create a Pull Request with comprehensive description linking to feature
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass and code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Merge feature branch to main branch upon approval

# Step 7 - Final Verification and Workflow Completion
- Call `mcp__task-review-manager__verify_all_tasks_complete` to confirm all tasks are "Done"
- **[UPDATED - Rec 1]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_snapshot` for final context-efficient overview
- **[NEW - Rec 5]** Call `mcp__task-review-manager__get_workflow_metrics` to get final health score:
  - Verify healthScore is 80+ (good quality)
  - Review rejection rates, rework cycles, and any alerts
  - Document metrics in PR description
- Review workflow history for each task:
  - Stakeholder review cycle: PendingProductDirector → PendingArchitect → PendingUiUxExpert → PendingSecurityOfficer → ReadyForDevelopment
  - Development cycle: ReadyForDevelopment → InProgress → InReview → InQA → Done
  - Any refinement loops: NeedsChanges cycles (if applicable)
- Generate detailed summary:
  - All changes made (from file transitions)
  - Stakeholder approvals summary
  - Implementation details and test coverage
  - Deployment readiness status
  - Files modified (consolidated from all task transitions)
  - **[NEW]** Workflow health metrics and quality indicators
- Confirm all acceptance criteria are marked as met
- Complete the workflow and report summary
